      <h1>Interests and sports/extracurriculars</h1>
      <p>I have a bunch of interests but the three main ones would be rowing, chess, and working out at the gym. I personally enjoy rowing a lot because is a sport where you can find the balance between relaxing and pushing yourself to your limits, and this happens in a short time which is what I love about the sport. I learned how to play chess at 6 years of age and I always enjoyed it, that feeling of better the one that teaches you is unmatched. Working out serves as a way of improving myself which is something I look towards to, it really serves as a distraction and a way to improve myself.</p>

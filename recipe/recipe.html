            <p>
                <u><strong>Tequeño</strong></u> is a traditional <u><strong>Venezuelan food</strong></u>, 
                and it is one of the main appetizers in Venezuelan parties. <u>It is a food made with 
                wheat flour dough and white cheese, then fried,</u> resulting in this popular 
                Venezuelan appetizer, an icon of the country's gastronomy that emerged at the end of

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="step">
                    <span>Place</span> flour and salt in workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade; pulse to combine. 
                    Sprinkle butter evenly over flour and pulse until butter is cut into pieces slightly smaller than a pea, about 
                    8 one-second pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    <span>Add</span> egg and water. Using a rubber spatula, press dough against side of bowl until it forms a ball. 
                    If dough is not fully forming, add additional water one tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Press 
                    dough into a disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and rest in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    <span>Unwrap</span> dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a square 1/8-inch thick. Cut off 
                    edges to create a 12-inch square. Cut square into 14 strips, each 3/4-inch wide.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    <span>Take</span> one strip of dough and drape end over top of one cheese slice. Wrap entire cheese slice in 
                    dough on a diagonal, overlapping dough. Cover bottom of cheese slice in dough and pinch edges close to fully 
                    seal. Repeat with remaining cheese slices.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    <span>Fill</span> a cast iron skillet with 3/4-inch of oil. Heat oil to 400°F (204°C) over high heat. Place 
                    tequeños in oil and fry until crust is golden brown and blistery, 3 to 5 minutes, turning halfway through. 
                    Transfer tequeños to a paper towel-lined plate, let cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then serve immediately.
